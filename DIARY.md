## 🧭 Legend – Problem Status

| Symbol | Meaning                                           |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ✅     | Solved independently                              |
| 💡     | Solved with help (e.g. editorial, hints)          |
| ❌     | Attempted but failed                              |
| 🟡     | Partial solution / needs more work                |
| 🔁     | Revisited / solved again                          |
| ✍️     | Worth taking notes or writing about               |
| 🧠     | Interesting trick / clever idea involved          |

> You can combine symbols, e.g. `💡🧠` means "solved with help and it had a clever trick".

### 🧠 Reflections

| Insight / Mistake / Thought                        |
| -------------------------------------------------- |
| Need to review construction problems (e.g., 2092B) |
| Start using snippets more consistently             |
| Brute force can still be optimal if n is small     |
